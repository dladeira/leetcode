# My LeetCode Problems

I want to get good at leetcode, so I try to do one a day. This is my public repo for me solving them, along with the date and how much time it took.

I really recommend the LeetCode extension on VSC

### Questions to ask

-   Input validation (Do I need to sanitize/validate the input)

### What I need to focus on

-   Handling base case (for example if array len == 1, sometimes just return array)
-   Edge cases
-   Default values (don't set it to -1000, set it to array[0])
